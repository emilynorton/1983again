# 1983again

This project is to recreate the first computer science animation project I ever did, senior year of high school in 1983. I was pretty proud of it.  It was the first time I realized that I understood code.  

What the program will do:  draw random points and in order start to connect these points.  Once it gets to the set amount of points, it will do the whole thing backwards and erase everything.  That's the animation.

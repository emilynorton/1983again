# 1983again

This project is to recreate the first computer science animation project I ever did, senior year of high school in 1983. I was pretty proud of it.  It was the first time I realized that I understood code.  

What the program will do:  Draw random points in random places within a defined area. In order and as the points are drawn, start to connect these points with a line.  Once it gets to the set amount of points, it will do the whole thing backwards and erase everything.  That's the animation.
